# notifications-app
Inspired from # Frontend Mentor - Notifications page

## Desired implementations

 The users should be able to: 

 - Leave a comment or a notification on the page;
 - The username and comments should be viewed in the bottom side of the page along with a profile picture;
 - Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero;
 - Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications;
 - See in real time the moment when a notification was sent;
 - Select the "X" icon and delete that notification from the stack;
 - Be warned when the "username and comment" fields are empty with a message displaying on a screen (like a popup window);
 - View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size;
 -
